A plugin for allowing embeds from the TwentyThree platform using a [twentythree] shortcode.

== Description ==
This plugin allows a user to embed videos from the TwentyThree Video Marketing
platform. Simply copy the embed code from your site backend, and surround it
with a [twentythree] shortcode: [twentythree]your-embed-here[/twentythree].

The plugin verifies that the embed code follows the pattern of a TwentyThree
embed code, but does not otherwise extract, modify or limit the embed code
contents.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release, tested on a Wordpress 4.0 installation.
